## Using the Location Sharing Feature

The application includes a location sharing feature that helps users see both their current location and sculpture locations on the map:

2. Allow the browser to access your location when prompted.
3. The map will automatically adjust to show:

This feature helps visitors easily navigate to sculptures by showing the spatial relationship between their current position and artwork locations.

{
